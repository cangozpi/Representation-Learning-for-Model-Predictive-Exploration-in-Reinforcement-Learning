    Setups torch.distributed and creates p_groups for training.
    In every node, the processes created by torch distributed (i.e. processes belonging to the default process group), will act 
    as the agent_processes which contain DPP covered Deep RL agent and perform training. Each of these agent processes will get a unique
    GPU, so you should have as many GPUs available as the number of agent processes you create in each node. Also, each agent process will
    manually spawn --num_env_per_process many environment processes which it will communicate over python multiprocessing Pipe to interact with the 
    environments in parallel. To get a better understanding check out the example below:
    In every node, 1 process (process with local_rank == 0) is assigned to the agents_group, the remaining processes are
    assigned to the env_workers_group. To get a better understanding check out the example below.


    Example:
        Available from torchrun:
            nnodes: number of nodes = 3
            nproc_per_node: number of processes per node = 2
