* states --> [num_worker, 4, 84, 84]: 4=(stacked_frames * H * W* 3), 84 is H and W.

fork() -> make a duplicate of the parent process + references the same memory as the parent + cheaper compared to spawn()
spawn() -> creates a totaly new process + brand new memory

OpenCL --> code runs on GPU
vs
MPI (Message Passing Interface) --> handles communication between processes running on different machines(GPUs).
